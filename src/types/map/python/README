The python files are taken from Moritz Klischat's 'scenario-generation' repository. Their version is the one of Max Fr√ºhauf's Bachelor's thesis, which can be found in the CPS archive. Adjustments have been applied to match the updates of the dependencies. Especially, the deprecated commonroad-curvilinear-coordinate-system has been replaced by the commonroad-drivability-checker repository.
